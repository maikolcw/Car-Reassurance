Anton Villadolid worked on The CSS and some functions.
Maikol Chow Wang worked on the html and some functions.
Misam Ibrahami worked on the research needed for the application.

Not all functions are inside the scripts to make it easier to search for (i.e, if we are absoultely sure the function is only relevant in that specific page).

.background and .bottomPadding are empty divs that implement CSS.

.background incorporates a background that remains static on the screen behind every element.

.bottomPadding is a safe way to globally add extra space to the bottom of the page.
